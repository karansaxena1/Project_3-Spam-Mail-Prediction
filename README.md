This project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify spam emails accurately. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and popular classification algorithms, the system aims to classify email messages as either "Spam Mail" or "Ham Mail."

## Key Features üîë
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning, tokenization, and removal of stopwords.
Transformation of text data into numerical representations using methods like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.

## Model Selection:

Comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms, such as:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Evaluation based on precision, recall, F1 score.

## Pipeline Implementation:
End-to-end pipeline integrating preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
### Python: Core programming language.
### Libraries:
### sklearn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
### nltk or spaCy: For text preprocessing and NLP tasks.
### matplotlib/seaborn: For data visualization.
### Google Colab Notebook: For interactive development and analysis.

## Dataset üìä
The dataset consists of a labeled collection of emails, categorized into "Spam" and "Not Spam". It includes features such as subject line, email body, and other metadata.

## Results üìà
Accuracy on Training Data : 0.9676912721561588

Accuracy on Test Data : 0.9668161434977578
